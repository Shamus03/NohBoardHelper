# NohBoardHelper
A helper utility for https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard
Easily create a .kb configuration with proper key IDs, location coordinates, and box sizes.

Adding a key:
  - Set the desired key width/height
  - Right click in an empty space
  - Use the left mouse to drag the key to the desired location (hold alt to disable snapping)
  - Hover the mouse over a key icon and press any key to set the key (some keys do not work because java is dumb)
  - Right click a key to remove it

Saving a keyboard configuration:
  - Set the category for the configuration (ex: "Games")
  - Type a file name (the .kb extension will be added automatically if you don't type it in)
  - Click "Save Config"
  - The file will be saved in the same directory as NohBoardHelper.jar
